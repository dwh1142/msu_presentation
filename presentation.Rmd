### Is Data!

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 8}
library(gapminder)
library(DT)

df <- gapminder 
gap <- df %>%
  select(-country) %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise_all(mean) %>%
  mutate(across(lifeExp:gdpPercap, round)) %>%
  arrange(year)

DT::datatable(
  head(gap, 20),
  fillContainer = FALSE, 
  options = list(pageLength = 7, dom ="ftip")) %>%
  formatCurrency('gdpPercap')
```

# And I really really love...

### Making cool data visualizations!

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}
library(plotly)

fig <- df %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~gdpPercap, 
    y = ~lifeExp, 
    size = ~pop, 
    color = ~continent, 
    frame = ~year, 
    text = ~country, 
    hoverinfo = "text",
    type = 'scatter',
    mode = 'markers',
    fill = ~'',
    marker = list(sizemode = 'diameter')
  )
fig <- fig %>% layout(
    xaxis = list(
      type = "log"
    )
  ) %>%
  config(displayModeBar = FALSE)

fig

# Data Products

---

# Data Products Can Be:

--
- Simple Reports


- Fancy Machine Learning Models


- Data Engineering Pipelines


- Slick Dashboards


- Databases


- Rest API Services


- Data Managment Tools


- And so much more...

--

### Typically it is a combination of many these!

# What truly makes something a data product is that...

- The mere existence of one of the aforementioned items doesn't constitute a data product if it doesn't help facilitate a solution to a problem.


--
- A simple report that allows end users to be more productive, and make well-informed decisions, is a great data product. 


--
- A complicated artificial intelligence solution that can't seem to make it's way to production is not a data product.
